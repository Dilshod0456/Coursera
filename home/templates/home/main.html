    <h1>Welcome to the DJ4E Samples</h1>
    <p>
    Here are some samples (Each will open in a new tab):
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/autos">Autos CRUD</a>
        <li><a href="/cats">Cats CRUD</a>
    </ul>
<p>
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Authenticated as
<pre>
Name: {{ user.get_full_name }}
Email: {{ user.email }}
Id: {{ user.id }}

Type: {% if backends.associated %} GitHub {% else %} Local {% endif %}
</pre>
</p>
<p>You can <a href="/accounts/logout">Logout</a></p>
{% else %}
<p>You can <a href="/accounts/login">Login</a> if you like.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if islocal %}
Some of the samples will require a user login to be created.

You
might need an account and password to log in for certain features.  You might try this:
<pre>
Username: dj4e-samples
Password: dj4e_nn_!
</pre>
There is a part of this password that you need to guess.  But if you have done your
homework, it should only take you one guess (instead of 100 guesses).
{% endif %}
